# MiDaS-Converter

This is a script that will create a duplicate of a given directory, containing depth estimates for every image contained in the given directory and its subfolders. 

## Usage
``python run.py <input_folder> <output_folder>``

For example, given the folder ``data`` in this repository, containing images and a subfolder of images, we can create a depth estimate folder ``output`` by running ``python run.py "./data" "./output"`` in the repo directory.
